# COVID-19 Vaccinations Trend Analysis

## Project Overview
This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 vaccination trends. The goal is to visualize how various countries have progressed in their vaccination efforts, highlighting disparities in vaccine distribution and coverage rates over time.

## Data Source
The analysis leverages an extensive dataset compiled in Excel, encompassing vaccination data from countries worldwide. Key data points include:
- **Country**
- **Date of Report**
- **Total Doses Administered**
- **Number of People Vaccinated with at Least One Dose**
- **Number of People Fully Vaccinated**
- **Type of Vaccines Used**

## Objectives
- **Trend Analysis:** Visualize vaccination trends over time across different regions.
- **Coverage Analysis:** Analyze vaccination coverage percentages in various countries.
- **Vaccine Type Distribution:** Identify the most commonly used vaccine types across regions.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Power BI:** Data importing, transformation, visualization, and analysis.
- **Excel:** Used for initial data storage and minor preprocessing.

## Power BI Dashboard Features
- **Interactive Visuals:** Includes line charts, bar charts, and world maps, dynamically updated based on user interactions.
- **Slicer Filters:** Users can filter data by country, date, or vaccine type.
- **Tooltip Details:** Detailed statistics are displayed when hovering over visual elements.

## Key Insights
- Highlights countries with the highest vaccination rates and the trends in vaccine distribution over time.
- Discusses any surprising patterns or anomalies found during the analysis.

## Challenges Faced
### Data Preprocessing Challenges
- **Data Inconsistency:** Addressed discrepancies in date formats and missing entries using Power BIâ€™s query editor.
- **Large Data Volume:** Optimized the data model to improve dashboard responsiveness by summarizing data and using efficient data types.

### Power BI Specific Challenges
- **Complex Visualizations:** Enhanced user interaction with advanced visualization tools like drill-through and tooltips.
- **Data Refresh Issues:** Configured data gateway connections and scheduled refreshes to ensure up-to-date dashboard data.

## Limitations and Future Improvements
- **Coverage Gaps:** Future versions may include more comprehensive data sources to cover all regions.
- **Vaccine Type Details:** Expanding data to include detailed vaccine efficacy could provide deeper insights.
- **Real-Time Data Integration:** Implementing an API for real-time data could enhance dashboard utility.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Integrating machine learning to predict future vaccination rates and potential outbreaks.

## Conclusion
This analysis can assist policymakers, health professionals, and the public in understanding the progress and challenges of global vaccination efforts, supporting better decision-making.
